# FaceForge

## Overview
FaceForge is a project that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic human faces. This project aims to demonstrate the power of GANs in generating high-quality images of human faces.

## Features
- Generates human faces using GANs
- Utilizes a discriminator and generator model architecture
- Provides options to customize the generated faces by adjusting parameters such as image size, batch size, and number of epochs

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Priyanshu085/FaceForge.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd FaceForge
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the main script to start generating faces:
```
python main.py
```

5. Generated faces will be saved in the `generate_face` directory.
